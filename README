This plugin allows parallel execution of tests as well as database integration.

General configuration is in conf/SeleniumConfig.groovy

selenium {
    servers = [
        [ name:'IE 8',    host: 'browserdev01', port:4444, browser:'*iehta',  url:'https://dev.inkchaser.com' ],
        [ name:'Firefox', host: 'browserdev02', port:4444, browser:'firefox', url:'https://dev.inkchaser.com' ],
    ]
}

General use is creating tests under test/selenium that extend SeleniumTestCase

Executing tests is by test-app :selenium

This will be better documented sometime in the future.
